aeropy - Xfoil Interaction tool
======

Python tools for Aeronautical calculations.

Genetic Optimization Algorithm in progress (python 3.4, xfoil6.99)

Includes:

-Minimal working interface between Python and Xfoil

-Interactive Ipython notebook showing how the genome-to-profile decodification works (in progress). 

Genetic algorithm modules:

-interfaz

-transcript

-main (in progress)

All 3 files must be in the same folder as xfoil.exe. Then, you can try the early version by executing main.py. It will decode an example genoma for 2 profiles, and then analize them with xfoil.
