This is a submodule for the genetic algorithm that is explained in
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_78ilFL-nbuN5KB5FmNeo-EIZly1PjqxqIB-ant-GfM/edit?usp=sharing

This script is the main program. It will call the different submodules
and manage the data transfer between them in order to achieve the
genetic optimization of the profile.
