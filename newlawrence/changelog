Â· Changes to version 1.1.0:

    - Model trimed to just only three layers (troposphere, tropopause and
        stratosphere).
    - Switched from a window functions based model to a layer selector.
    - Doubled size allowed for numpy arrays (switched from int to unsigned
        ints for indexes).
    - Code clean up.
